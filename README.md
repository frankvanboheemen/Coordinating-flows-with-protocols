In this project a way to structure your code with coordinators can be found. 

It is a look on app-architecture for apps in Swift (and Xcode) from the perspective of a UX-designer.

On the one hand it supports user flows which require users to go through several views to reach their goal. And on the other hand it combines modularity and reusability with the practicality of storyboards in Xcode. 

Additionally, this way of structuring your code also allows you to communicate more effectively with the various types of members of a scrum-team, including the less technical members (because of the visual advantages of using storyboards), while at the same time preventing merge conflicts in Git when team members work on different features simultaneously.
